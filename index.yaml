      description: As status checks are core features of the PM connected car experience, this feature is allowed by default in the customer account settings. However, users do have the option to revoke remote status reporting access to APIs and rely only on the car dashboard indicators. Thus, developers should check for a successful response before continuing with any further workflows.
